# hello-world
This is my first own project on github.
My name is Karol. I am an ekkngineer. My journey with programming has started during my studies - I was a student of techincal physics.
Now I work as a software test engineer and github is a tool that I would like to know more about, just to improve my skills and work efficiency.
